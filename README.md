# Exercism Solutions

This repository contains my completed exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/).

Each folder corresponds to a track (e.g. Python, JavaScript, etc.), and inside are my submitted solutions for the challenges.

## Purpose
- Keep track of my progress on Exercism.
- Share solutions with others.
- Use GitHub as a backup for my work.
